this is a display to see some stat (i think the more importants).
has been thought to use it as overlay on stream
you can change between a green and blue screen in base of the skin
and search for a player name 

if you wanna use it on stream just add a browser source --> [this link](https://mcsrrankdisplay.netlify.app)
--> interact, and add your name 

for now its a beta, it works but it needs some adjustements

i used the MCSR ranked API [link](https://github.com/MCSR-Ranked)

tnx :)
